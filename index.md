# Picross Solver using Constraint Programming
This project is a side project, whose goal was to reinforce my knowledge and understanding of Constraint Programming.

A report is available [here](https://github.com/BenoitBOMPOL/PicrossSolverCP/blob/main/Picross_ConstraintProgramming.pdf) which summarizes my approach and my results. It might not be up to date and am available for more inquiries.

## What has been done so far.
1. A `.px` generic instance file has been created in order to create benchmarks later on.
2. 🐖 : PIG (**P**icross **I**nstance **G**enerator), small python module creating `.px` instances from a Graphical interface.
3. 🧠 : Writing a **checker**, ensuring every solution provided is correct

## What could be done (if I had more time)
1. ↪️ : Defining properly the level of consistency of our model.
2. 🚅 : Benchmarking : How many nodes are used ? How many tuples were enumerated ?
3. The level of reasoning is currently the one of a rather good human player.
